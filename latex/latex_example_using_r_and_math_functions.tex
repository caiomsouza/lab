\subsection{The salary function test}

The salary function:

 \begin{equation}
 f(x)  = rent \div 0.3 )
 \end{equation}
 
 
To estimate the salary: \(f(x) = \displaystyle \frac{rent}{0.3}\), we cannot say this is correct, but it can help people estimate how much money they need to earn based on a easy variable to get, the price to rent a house in a specific place. 
 
This document is only an example for self study about how to use R and Latex.
